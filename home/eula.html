          are at least 18 years old, whether acting on their own behalf or as an authorized employee or representative
          of a corporation or other business entity. You hereby warrant that you are at least 18 years old. In the event
          that the information you provide in this regard is untrue, Ringo shall not be liable as we are unable to
          verify the age of its users. If you are under 18 years old, do not attempt to register for the App or the
          Service. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the Service only with the approval of your parent or
          guardian. Additionally, you should review these terms with your parent or guardian to ensure that you and your
          parent or guardian understand and agree to these terms.
          You may not (i) select or use as a Ringo User ID a person's name other than your own with the intention to
          imitate that person; (ii) use a Ringo User ID with the name of a person other than you without appropriate
          authorization; (iii) use a Ringo User ID name that is vulgar, obscene, or otherwise offensive; (iv) use or
          attempt to use another user’s account, username, or password without their permission; (v) buy, sell, rent, or
          lease access to your Snapchat account, Snaps, a Snapchat username, or a friend link without our written
          permission. We reserve the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a Ringo User ID at our discretion. If
          you select a User ID for your account, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it infringes
          upon another's rights or marks. You are responsible for all activities taking place under your Ringo User ID
          and for keeping your password confidential and secure, and you agree to immediately notify us of any
          unauthorized use of your Ringo User ID or password.
          While there are limited and legitimate reasons for creating multiple accounts, creating serial or overlapping
          accounts may lead to account termination. Please contact us if you have questions about managing multiple
          accounts.

          Digital Millennium Copyright Act; Procedure for Making Claims of Infringement
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          You agree to only upload, post, submit or otherwise transmit User Contributed Content: (i) that you have the
          legal right to use, copy, distribute, transmit, or display; and (ii) that does not infringe upon the
          intellectual property rights or violate the privacy rights of any third party (including, without limitation,
          copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right, or moral right or right of
          publicity). Ringo respects the legal rights of others and requests that its users do the same. It is Ringo's
          policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright or other forms of intellectual property infringement
          provided they comply with applicable laws (most notably, the United States' Digital Millennium Copyright Act
          or “DMCA”). Repeat offenders will, at Ringo's option, have their user accounts and/or access to the App and
          the Service removed or disabled regardless of the status of any particular notification or
          counter-notification. If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please
          provide Ringo with a written notice of the same with the following information:
          • - The full name, mailing address, telephone number, contact email address and physical or electronic
          signature of an owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, or a person or entity specifically
          authorized to act on that owner's behalf;
          • - Identification of the works claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple works at a single online site
          are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
          • - Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
          activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient
          to permit Ringo to locate said material;
          • - A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner
          complained of is not authorized by the rights holder, his/her/its agent, or the law;
          • - A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the
          complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
          infringed; and
          • - Any supporting documentation to help establish the rights at issue, such as copies of a valid and duly
          executed copyright registration certificate.
          • - Notices should be delivered to Ringo’s Agent for Notices of Infringement Claims:
          • - Email: support@Ringo.world
          Ringo will, upon receipt of a properly-formatted notice, act promptly to remove the allegedly offending
          content or disable public access to it. Ringo will also send a copy of any infringement notice to the party
          said to be responsible for the infringement at issue. If you have received such a notice, you may choose to
          file a counter-notice, stating essentially that you dispute the allegations made in the notice and formally
          requesting that any material removed or disabled be reposted. A counter-notification should include the
          following information:
          • - The full name, address, telephone number, contact email address and physical or electronic signature of
          the party named in the infringement notice, or a person or entity specifically authorized to act on
          his/her/its behalf.
          • - Identification of the material(s) claimed to have been removed or disabled by Ringo, and information
          reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to determine its prior location;
          • - A statement that the party making the counter-notice has a good faith belief that use of the material in
          the manner complained of is not authorized by the rights holder, his/her/its agent, or the law;
          • - A statement that the information in the counter-notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury,
          that the materials removed were removed or disabled as a result of misidentification or wrongful allegation;
          • - A statement that you will accept jurisdiction for disputes relating to this matter in either: (i) the
          Federal District Court in the district that you reside in; or (ii) if you reside outside of the U.S.A., in the
          District of California.
          • - Any supporting documentation to help establish the statements contained in your counter-notification.

          You acknowledge that you are using the App, the Service, and the Ringo Content at your own risk and that
          Ringo, along with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
          representatives (collectively, the "Ringo Parties"), will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer
          system, loss of data, or other harm resulting from your access to or use of the aforementioned. The App, the
          Service, and the Ringo Content are provided on an "as is" basis, and the Ringo Parties hereby expressly
          disclaim any and all warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to any warranties of
          accuracy, reliability, title, merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or any
          other warranty, condition, guarantee, or representation, whether oral, in writing, or in electronic form,

          The Ringo Parties shall not be liable to you or any third parties for any direct, indirect, special,

          App, the Service, or the Ringo Content herein, the sale or purchase of any products, services, or merchandise
          via the App or the Service and any injury or damage caused thereby, any misrepresentation or fraud by a user,

          Content, or any of the merchandise, information, or materials available on the App regardless of the type of
          claim or the nature of the cause of action, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do
          not permit the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or
          consequential damages, so the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. You may also have other
          rights that vary from state to state.
          You hereby agree to release the Ringo Parties from any and all claims, demands, and damages (actual and

          in part: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in
          his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his
          settlement with the debtor". The total cumulative liability of the Ringo Parties in connection with this

          Arbitration
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
          If any dispute, controversy or claim emerges among the parties under, out of, or in relation to this
          Agreement, including any dispute related to the formation, construction, interpretation, or breach of this
          Agreement or a party's performance of its obligations herein (“Dispute”), the parties shall initially strive
          to resolve the Dispute through mutual and good faith consultation. If the Dispute is not settled in this way
          within forty-five (45) days from a party's notice of a Dispute, then any party may serve a notice on the other
          party demanding that the Dispute be submitted to arbitration as follows:

          Any Dispute (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as specified below) associated with
          this Agreement where the total amount of the award sought is less than five thousand U.S. Dollars (US$
          5,000.00) can be resolved in a cost-efficient manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the
          option of the party seeking relief. Such arbitration shall be initiated via an established alternative dispute
          resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as stated in this section and in accordance with
          the rules of such ADR Provider, except to the extent that such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The
          party requesting arbitration will propose an ADR Provider and the other party shall not unreasonably withhold
          consent to utilize such ADR Provider. The ADR Provider and the parties must adhere to the following rules: a)
          the arbitration can be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, and the
          specific method shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; b) all arbitration proceedings shall
          be conducted in English; c) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or
          witnesses unless mutually agreed otherwise by the parties; and d) any judgment on the award given by the
          arbitrator can be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs
          (including attorney fees) and disbursements resulting from the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of
          the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

          Any other Dispute (including whether the claims asserted can be arbitrated) shall be referred to and
          ultimately determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “Rules”)
          and shall be managed by the Los Angeles office of JAMS (the “Administrator”). To the extent there is any
          conflict between the provisions stipulated in this section and any procedural or other rules issued by the
          Administrator, this section shall prevail. The location of the arbitration shall be Los Angeles, California,
          USA. The Dispute(s) shall be submitted to a single arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) chosen by the parties or selected
          by the parties from a list of potential arbitrators provided by the Administrator. The Administrator shall
          provide such list to the parties 10 days upon the request of either party. If the parties are unable to agree
          on the choice of arbitrator within 10 days after receiving the list from the Administrator, then the
          Administrator will select the Arbitrator. The arbitral proceedings, and all pleadings and written evidence
          shall be in the English language. Any written evidence originally in a language other than English shall be
          submitted in English translation along with the original or true copy thereof. The English language version
          shall prevail. Each party shall bear its own attorney fees, costs, and disbursements arising from the
          arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator;
          however, the Arbitrator shall be empowered to determine whether a party is the prevailing party, and if so, to
          award to that prevailing party reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements
          (including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, photocopy charges, travel expenses, etc.), and/or
          the fees and costs of the Administrator and the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award and
          statement of decision outlining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including
          the calculation of any damages awarded. The Arbitrator shall not have the authority to award damages exceeding
          any limitations set forth in this Agreement. Judgment on the award of the Arbitrators can be entered by any
          court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator shall also be authorized to grant any temporary, preliminary
          or permanent equitable remedy or relief it deems just and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement,
          including, without limitation, an injunction or order for specific performance. The arbitration award shall be
          final and binding on the parties without appeal or review except as permitted by California law or United
          States Federal law.
          Despite the foregoing, Ringo may directly turn to any court of competent jurisdiction to seek protection or
          enforcement of its intellectual property rights and/or to obtain injunctive relief or other equitable relief.
