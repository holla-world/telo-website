          What Does this Privacy Policy Cover?
          </header>
          <div class="section-content">
This Privacy Policy pertains to Ringo's handling of Personal Information that we gather while you are utilizing the App and the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Ringo does not own or control, including but not limited to third-party services you access via Ringo, the App or the Service, or to individuals that Ringo does not employ or manage. As our Service integrates with third-party sites such as Facebook and other sites and social networks, we assume that you are already acquainted with the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our App and/or Service and when you permit us to interact with these sites and networks on your behalf.

          The Service
          </header>
          <div class="section-content">
The core functionality of Ringo is a real-time video chat mobile application where users can encounter interesting and cool people from all over the world, enjoy pleasant chats, and make new friends on our platform. It pairs individuals (“Users”) based on compatibility and other factors, and enables individuals to chat and communicate online through various mediums including text, video, linking and accessing third-party social network platforms such as but not limited to Snapchat (collectively, the “Service”).
In accordance with relevant international regulations, Ringo will not provide the Service in the following countries or territories:
Cuba
Iran
Syria
North Korea
Crimea
So-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR)
Russia

          Information We Collect
          </header>
          <div class="section-content">
There are three fundamental ways we collect information:
• - Information you voluntarily provide us
• - Information we obtain when you use our services
• - Information we obtain from third parties
Here’s a more detailed account of each of these categories.
          </div>

          Information You Choose to Give Us
          </header>
          <div class="section-content">
By visiting and interacting with Ringo, its App and/or its Service, you furnish us with Personal Information which may include, but is not limited to, the following:
• - Personally Identifiable Information: may include, without limitation, information provided when you register to use the App and/or the Service, including your name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, address, email address, occupation, employer, gender, age, birthday, Facebook account info and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and ‘likes' and preferences, friend lists and number of friends you have via social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, usage information regarding your utilization of the Service, profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser information.
• - The information you choose to provide above may be shared with your contacts on our service. You have complete control over your profile information and can access and modify it at any time. Additionally, if you register to our service with your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you grant us your express consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make accessible on Facebook (for instance, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is accessible to other users of the Service who are connected to you on our service. Furthermore, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile is discoverable by other users. You may choose to “block” any user on our platform to prevent unwanted access to your Personal Information.
• - You may also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with us (including names, numbers, emails, Facebook ID, Apple ID, etc) and we will store it on our servers to assist you in enhancing our service, e.g. connecting with friends on our service. If you do not wish us to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings or notify us via email. If you do so, we will not be able to offer certain features of our service.
Naturally, you’ll also provide us with any information you send through the services. Bear in mind that the users you send texts, images, and any other content to can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense applicable to the Internet at large applies to Ringo as well: Don’t send messages or share content that you wouldn’t want someone to save or share.
It likely goes without saying, but we’ll state it anyway: When you contact Ringo Support or communicate with us in any other manner, we’ll collect whatever information you volunteer.

          Information We Get When You Use Our Services
          </header>
          <div class="section-content">
When you utilize our services, we collect information about which of those services you’ve used and how you’ve employed them. We might be aware, for example, that you used one of the filters in the app and the number of times you have used this filter. Here’s a more comprehensive explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:
Usage Information. We collect information about your activity through our services. We may collect information including but not limited to:
• - How you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or the number of times you apply to discover.
• - How you communicate with other Ringo users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot). We allow you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other forms of communications on our service with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications may be stored on our servers. Additionally, if you choose to share these items with other users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications on our service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is utilized and that it may become publicly available. We are not accountable for any use or misuse of information you share.
• - Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, none direct display of content moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).
• - User content e.g. photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials that you create on the service may also be collected. Your photos and videos may be captured by other users on the service, and those contents can be stored and used by us or third-party services (e.g. Facebook) for content moderation and community safety monitoring purposes. You can modify third-party sharing options in our product settings or write to us directly.
• - Device Phonebook. Since Ringo is all about communicating with friends, we may—with your consent—collect information from your device’s phonebook.
• - Location Information. When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.
• -Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may utilize cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can typically remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could impact the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please review our Cookie Statement. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our privacy policy.

• - Details about how you’ve used our services.
• - Device information, such as your web browser type and language.
• - Access times.
• - Pages viewed.
• - IP address.
• - Identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.

• We may collect information that other users provide about you when they utilize our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and combine that with the information we collect through our services.

          How We Share Information
          </header>

In specific instances, we may share your personal information with third-party service providers to further enhance and optimize our service for you. We may share information about you in the following ways:
• - With other users. We may share the following information with other users
• - Information about you, such as your username and name;
• - Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as the names of users you are friends with, and other information that will assist users in understanding your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Ringo friends in common;
• - Any additional information you have consented for us to share. For example, when you permit us to access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook;
• - With all users and the general public. We may share the following information with all users as well as the general public:
• - Public information like your profile pictures that you submit to Local. If a Local service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it may be viewed by the public at large.

• - Comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;
• - Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;

• - In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
You expressly consent that information provided when you register the App and/or the content you created when using the App (including without limitation, photos, text, messages, posts, html, URLs, pictures, video and other content), may be recorded, stored, published and made available to the rest of Ringo users. Furthermore, other users may follow you on the App, and your followers can see, for example, the user contributed content that you have uploaded to the App. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in the information you provide or content that you create in the App.

Finally，and this is significant you should understand that users who see the content you provide can always save it using various techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It’s also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be able to access messages forensically or find them in a device’s temporary storage. If any deletion of user information of our App occurs, we cannot guarantee that deletion will take place within a specific time frame. And we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.

Protecting user privacy and personal information is a primary concern for us. We process your personal information to improve and enforce our security measures, combat spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks, and to monitor and verify your identity so that unauthorized users do not access your account with us. Access to any user information is restricted to our employees, contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY who need to know the information in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize our service experience and security. We use password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all user information. Due to the inherent nature of the internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse, or alteration.

          <div class="section-content">
We want you to have control over your information, so we provide you with the following tools.
• - Access and Updates. We strive to allow you to access and control the personal information that we have about you. There are limitations though to the requests we’ll accommodate. We may reject a request for several reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information directly in the app by visiting the app’s Settings page. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information that we may have, you can submit a request here. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we allow you to access or update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or process account deletion.
• - Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind about our ongoing ability to collect information from certain sources that you have already consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by changing the settings on your device if your device offers those options. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.
• - Erasure. You have the right to request the deletion of your personal information in certain circumstances. Please note that your right to erasure may be limited if the data are necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
• - Restriction on Processing: You have the right to object to and request restrictions on the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.
• - Objection: You have the right to object, on grounds related to your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of your personal information.
Ringo shall no longer process the personal information unless Ringo demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
