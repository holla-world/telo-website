            Welcome to Ringo! We have composed these Terms of Service (which we
            simply refer to as the "Terms") to ensure you are aware of the
            regulations governing our relationship with you. Despite our efforts
            to minimize legal jargon in the Terms, there are still sections that
            might resemble a traditional contract. There's a valid reason for
            this: These Terms indeed constitute a legally binding agreement
            between you and FREE CHAT TECHNOLOGY LIMITED. So, please read them
            attentively. By using the Services, you consent to the Terms.
            Naturally, if you don't concur with them, then refrain from using
            the Services. The following Terms of Service delineate your
            responsibilities when utilizing our mobile application (“App”) or
            Service (as defined herein), or any of the information, text,
            graphics, videos, or other files, materials, data or content of any
            sort created or provided by or through the App or the Service or
            through your ability to sell products on the App and generate User
            Contributed Content (as defined herein). Kindly also review our
            Privacy Policy, which is a component of these Terms of Service and
            which details our approaches towards handling any personal
            information you might provide to us. The App and the Service are
            owned and operated by FREE CHAT TECHNOLOGY LIMITED and are accessed
            by you under the Terms of Service described herein (“Terms of
            Service” or “Agreement”). Please peruse these Terms of Service
            meticulously before using the App or the Service. By accessing the
            App or employing any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by
            these terms and conditions. If you do not consent to all these terms
            and conditions, then you may not access the App or utilize the
            Service. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as conferring
            any rights or benefits to third parties. ARBITRATION NOTE: WE WANT
            TO INFORM YOU IN ADVANCE THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION
            CLAUSE A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES
            MENTIONED IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND Ringo AGREE THAT
            DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH MANDATORY BINDING
            ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND Ringo WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A
            CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

            non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access
            and utilize the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of
            enabling you to use and enjoy the benefits of the Service in a
            manner compliant with these Terms and our usage policies. Any
            software that we provide to you might automatically download and

            portion of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to

            Many of our Services allow you to create, upload, post, send,
            receive, and store content. When you do this, you retain whatever
            ownership rights in that content you initially had. However, you
            grant us a license to use that content. The extent of this license
            depends on which services you use and the settings you have chosen.
            For all Services, you grant Ringo a global, royalty-free,
            sublicensable,and transferable license to host, store, use, display,
            reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that
            content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating,
            developing, providing, promoting, and enhancing the Services and
            researching and developing new ones. Because Local is inherently
            public and chronicles matters of public interest, the license you
            grant us for content submitted to those Services is more
            extensive.In addition to the rights, you grant us in connection with
            other Services, you also grant us a perpetual license to create
            derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate,
            publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Local or
            any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all
            media or distribution methods (currently known or developed later).
            To the extent necessary, you also grant Ringo and our business
            partners the unrestricted, global, perpetual right and license to
            use your name, likeness, local content that you upload or send. This
            implies, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any
            compensation from Ringo or our business partners if your name,
            likeness or Local. While we are not obligated to do so, we may
            access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for
            any reason, including if we deem your content violates these Terms.
            You alone, however, remain accountable for the content you create,
            upload, post, send, or store through the Service. The services might
            contain advertisements. In consideration for Ringo allowing, you to
            access and use the Services, you agree that Ringo, its affiliates,
            and third-party partners may place advertising on the Services. We
            always enjoy hearing from our users. But if you voluntarily offer
            feedback or suggestions, just be aware that we can utilize your
            ideas without compensating you.

            purchase and use through the Services. You do not own these
            Services; instead, you purchase sufficient app gems to use them. You
            will always be shown the price for Services before you complete a
            purchase. However, Ringo does not handle payments or payment
            processing for any purchases; those are handled by third-party
            payment providers or service providers (such as, Apple's iOS Store
            and Google's Google Play Store, among others). Some third-party
            service providers may charge you sales tax, depending on where you
            live. Please review the relevant terms of the third-party service
            provider for details. Subject to any applicable additional terms and
            conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable. And because
            our performance commences once you tap buy and we provide you with
            immediate access to your purchase, you waive any right you may have
            under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it is
            completed or to obtain a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE
            THAT Ringo IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON. Some
            of the Virtual Products we offer are for single-use only, while
            others are for repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does
            not mean "forever." We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual
            Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will
            not be liable to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend
            or terminate your account, you will lose any products you purchased
            through the services. If your Ringo account remains inactive for 3
            consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins may be frozen. To
            unfreeze such virtual Coins, you must email us and request that we
            unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receipt of your request and
            review of your information, we will unfreeze your free virtual Coins
            as soon as possible. You agree that we have the absolute right to
            manage, distribute, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as
            we deem fit in our sole discretion, and that we will have no
            liability for exercising such right. You agree that under no
            circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or claims that
            may arise from the loss or use of your Coins regardless of the
            circumstances. It is your sole responsibility to manage your
            purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal
            majority in your place of residence), you must obtain your parent's
            or guardian's consent before making any purchases. Ringo does not
            transfer any funds and is not a money-services business. To the
            extent such functionality is available in the Services, it is
            provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other
            third-party service, it is subject to that third party's separate
            Terms of Service. Ringo offers in-app purchases ("IAP") through
            iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by
            Ringo. If you choose to make an IAP, you will be prompted to enter
            details for your account with your application platform, and your
            application platform account (e.g. iTunes Account) will be charged
            for the IAP in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the
            time of purchase as well as the general terms for IAP that apply to
            your application platform account. Some application platforms may
            charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase
            an auto-recurring periodic subscription IAP, your application
            platform account will continue to be billed for the subscription
            until you cancel the IAP. After your initial subscription commitment
            period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your
            subscription will automatically continue for an additional
            equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If
            you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you
            want to change or terminate your subscription, you can do so within
            the Ringo app or log in to your application platform account and
            follow the instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you
            have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted
            the Ringo application from your device. If you cancel your
            subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your
            then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be
            renewed after your then-current term expires. Deleting your account
            on Ringo or deleting the Ringo application from your device does not
            cancel your subscription; Ringo will retain all funds charged to
            your application platform until you cancel your subscription.
            Generally, all charges for IAP are non-refundable, and there are no
            refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an
            exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested
            within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws
            applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. For subscribers
            residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with
            local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days
            after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period
            starts when the subscription commences. To request a refund: If you
            subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not
            Ringo. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID,
            select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit "Report
            Problem". You can also submit a request at
            https://getsupport.apple.com. If you subscribed using your Google
            Play Store account: please contact Google Play customer support with
            your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order
            number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google
            Wallet).

            To reward Users for certain activities, Ringo may provide you with
            the opportunity to earn and use credits in Ringo’s in-app virtual
            currency (“Coins”) that can be used to acquire virtual goods and
            services solely within the Services. Coins are not real money, have
            no monetary value, and can never be redeemed for “real world” money
            or other items of monetary value from outside the Services without
            our written permission. While we might use terms like “earn”,
            “trade-in”, or “cash-out” in reference to the Coins, we do so only
            for convenience and such terms in no way suggest that Coins have
            monetary value or are real money. You acknowledge that Coins are not
            real currency and cannot be redeemed for any sum of money from us at
            any time. We make no guarantee regarding the nature, quality, or
            value of the features of the Services or any third-party goods or
            services that will be accessible through the use of Coins, or the
            availability or supply of Coins. Coins obtained through the Services
            are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable,
            non-transferable, non-sublicensable license for use within the
            Services. Coins cannot be transferred to other accounts or resold in
            any way, have no property interest, right or title in or to any
            Coins appearing or originating in the Services or any other
            attributes associated with the use of the Services. Any “virtual
            currency” balance shown in your account does not represent a
            real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead
            constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. All Coins
            are forfeited if your account or access to the Services is
            terminated or suspended for any reason, at our sole and absolute
            discretion, or if we discontinue the availability of some or all of
            the Services. We may at any time expire free or promotional Coins
            given to you. We have no liability for the hacking or loss of your
            Coins or any goods or services obtained using Coins. We have no
            obligation to, and will not, reimburse you for any Coins that are
            lost due to your violation of these Terms. We reserve the right,
            without prior notification, to limit the quantity of Coins and to
            refuse to provide you with any Coins. The price, exchangeability and
            availability of Coins are determined by us at our sole discretion
            and are subject to change without notice. You agree that we have the
            absolute right to manage, distribute, regulate, control, modify, or
            eliminate Coins as we see fit at our sole discretion, and that we
            will have no liability for exercising such right. You agree that
            under no circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or
            claims that may arise from the loss or use of your Coins regardless
            of the circumstances. User inactivity - If your account remains
            inactive for 3 consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins
            may be frozen. To unfreeze such virtual Coins, you must email us and
            request that we unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receipt of
            your request and review of your information, we will unfreeze your
            free virtual Coins as soon as possible. You relieve us of any
            responsibility for maintaining or updating your account Coins
            balance. However, if there is a loss of Coins in your account due to
            technical or operational problems with the Services, we will refund
            the lost Coins once the loss has been verified. Without limiting any
            of the foregoing, our maximum liability or responsibility to you is
            to refund the lost Coins. You may from time to time be presented
            with opportunities to redeem Coins. We will, at our sole discretion,
            determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate for any
            Coins, which may be modified at any time. We reserve the right to
            cancel, restrict or terminate Coins at any time for any reason. All
            redemptions are subject to these Terms and all limitations and
            requirements stated via the Services. All acquisitions and
            redemptions of Coins are final. Once Coins have been lost or spent,
            they will be deducted from your account and cannot be refunded or
            returned, except at our sole discretion.

          <div class="section-content">
            PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE
            YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH Ringo AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH
            YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
            All claims and disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or
            the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims
            court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual
            basis, except that you and Ringo are not obligated to arbitrate any
            dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged
            unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade
            secrets, or patents. Arbitration Rules. United States Arbitration
            Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
            dispute-resolution provision. Arbitration will be initiated through
            the United States International Economic and Trade Arbitration
            (“USIETAC”). If the USIETAC is unavailable to arbitrate, the parties
            will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral
            forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the
            extent those rules conflict with these Terms. Additional Rules for
            Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is chosen,
            the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written
            submissions, or any combination of the three; the specific method
            will be selected by the party initiating the arbitration. The
            arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties
            or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Authority
            of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will determine the jurisdiction of
            the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
            Ringo. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters
            or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have
            the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
            claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award
            monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
            available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral
            forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written
            award and statement of decision describing the essential findings
            and conclusions on which the award is based, including the
            calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same
            authority to award relief on an individual basis as a judge in a
            court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and
            binding on you and Ringo. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
            ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
            AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
            NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAYS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT
            BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
            OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or
            consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you
            nor we are entitled to arbitration. Confidentiality. No part of the
            procedures will be open to the public or the media. All evidence
            discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not
            be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant
            to court order, or unless required by law. Notwithstanding the
            foregoing, no party will be prevented from submitting to a court of
            law any information needed to enforce this arbitration agreement, to
            enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable
            relief. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this
            arbitration agreement may be waived by the party against whom the
            claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other

            Given the wide range of our services, we sometimes need to create
            additional terms and conditions for specific services. Those
            additional terms and conditions, which will be available with the
            relevant Services, then become part of your agreement with us if you
