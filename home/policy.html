        What Is Covered by this Privacy Policy?
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
This Privacy Policy relates to the handling of Personal Information by Ringo when you are using the App and the Service. This policy is not applicable to the practices of third parties that are not owned or controlled by Ringo, including but not limited to third-party services that you access through Ringo, the App or the Service, or to individuals that are not employed or managed by Ringo. Since our Service integrates with third-party sites like Facebook and other sites and social networks, we assume that you are already familiar with the privacy policies of those other sites and networks when using our App and/or Service and when you allow us to interact with these sites and networks on your behalf.

        The Service
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
The main function of Ringo is a real-time video chat mobile application, enabling users to meet interesting and cool people from all around the world, have pleasant conversations, and make new friends on our platform. It matches individuals (“Users”) based on compatibility and other factors and allows them to chat and communicate online through various means, including text, video, linking and accessing third-party social network platforms such as, but not limited to, Snapchat (collectively, the “Service”).
In line with relevant international regulations, Ringo will not offer the Service in the following countries or territories:
Cuba
Iran
Syria
North Korea
Crimea
The so-called Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) and Luhansk People's Republic (LNR)

        The Information We Gather
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
There are three basic ways in which we collect information:
• - Information you voluntarily offer to us
• - Information we acquire when you utilize our services
• - Information we obtain from third parties
Here is a more detailed description of each of these categories.
        </div>

        <header class="section-title">
       Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
By visiting and interacting with Ringo, its App and/or its Service, you provide us with Personal Information, which may comprise, but is not limited to, the following:
• - Personally Identifiable Information: This might include, without restriction, the information given when you register to use the App and/or the Service, such as your name, profile picture, date of birth, phone number, phone book content, address, email address, occupation, employer, gender, age, birthday, Facebook account details and friend list, and/or other social network usernames and 'likes' and preferences, friend lists and the number of friends you have through social networks, messages to other users of the App and the Service, usage information regarding your utilization of the Service, the profile picture that you upload via the App or the Service, and browser information.
• - The information you choose to provide as mentioned above may be shared with your contacts on our service. You have full control over your profile information and can access and modify it at any time. Additionally, if you register to our service using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we might store your Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your explicit consent, we will have access to and may collect certain information that you make accessible on Facebook (for example, your first and last names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is accessible to other users of the Service who are connected to you on our service. Furthermore, unless you choose to opt-out (which you can do at any time in the settings of our application), your Profile can be discovered by other users. You can choose to “block” any user on our platform to prevent unauthorized access to your Personal Information.
• - You might also choose to share your mobile device’s Contacts list with us (including names, numbers, emails, Facebook ID, Apple ID, etc) and we will store it on our servers to assist you in enhancing our service, for example, connecting with friends on our service. If you do not want us to store this information, you can opt-out through your account settings or notify us via email. If you do this, we will not be able to offer certain features of our service.
Naturally, you will also provide us with any information you send through the services. It should be borne in mind that the users to whom you send texts, images, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app. So, the same common sense applicable to the Internet in general also applies to Ringo: Don’t send messages or share content that you would not want someone to save or share.
It probably goes without saying, but we will state it anyway: When you contact Ringo Support or communicate with us in any other way, we will collect whatever information you offer voluntarily.

        Information We Obtain When You Utilize Our Services
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
When you make use of our services, we gather information about which of those services you have utilized and how you have employed them. For instance, we might be aware that you used one of the filters in the app and the number of times you have employed this filter. Here is a more thorough explanation of the kinds of information we collect when you use our services:

Usage Information. We collect information regarding your activity through our services. We may collect information including but not limited to:
• - How you interact with the services, such as which filters you view or the number of times you apply to discover.
• - How you communicate with other Ringo users, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or take a screenshot). We allow you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other forms of communications on our service with other users, and if you opt to do so, your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications may be stored on our servers. Additionally, if you choose to share these items with other users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications on our service is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should be aware that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly accessible. We are not responsible for any use or misuse of the information you share.
• - Device Information. We collect device-specific information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, advertising identifier, unique application identifiers, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, wireless network, non-direct display of content moderation, and mobile network information (including the mobile phone number).
• - User content such as photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials that you create on the service may also be collected. Your photos and videos may be captured by other users on the service, and those contents can be stored and used by us or third-party services (e.g. Facebook) for content moderation and community safety monitoring purposes. You can modify third-party sharing options in our product settings or write to us directly.
• - Device Phonebook. Since Ringo is all about communicating with friends, we may – with your consent – collect information from your device’s phonebook.
• - Location Information. When you use our services, we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.
• - Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies. Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also employ these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as commerce features. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can typically remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Bear in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services. To learn more about how we use cookies and your choices, please review our Cookie Statement. To learn more about how third parties use these technologies on our services, be sure to read the Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others section of our privacy policy.
• - Log Information. We also collect log information when you use our website. That information includes, among other things:
• - Details about how you have used our services.
• - Device information, such as your web browser type and language.
• - Access times.
• - Pages viewed.
• - IP address.
• - Identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.
• - Pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.
• - If you contact us by email and other means (Twitter, Facebook, etc), we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence and will use these contact info and correspondence if we respond to you.

        Information Collected by Us from Third Parties
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
• We might collect information that other users supply regarding you when they make use of our services. For instance, if another user permits us to gather information from their device phonebook – and you are one of that user’s contacts – we could combine the information we gather from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also acquire information from other companies that are owned or operated by us, or any other third-party sources, and merge that with the information we collect via our services.

        How We Use Information
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
• What do we do with the information we gather? The concise answer is: Provide you with an astonishing range of products and services that we constantly enhance. But we do a lot more as well, such as:
• - Develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.
• - Communicate with you.
• - Monitor and analyze trends and usage.
• - Customize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information, or tailoring the content we show you, including ads.

• - Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activities.
• - Utilize the information we've collected from cookies and other technologies to improve the services and your experience with them.

        How We Share Information
        </header>
        <div class="section-content">
In specific circumstances, we might share your personal information with third-party service providers to further enhance and optimize our service for you. We may share information about you in the following manners:
• - With other users. We may share the following information with other users:
• - Information about you, such as your username and name;
• - Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as the names of users you are friends with, and other information that will help users understand your connections with others using the services. For instance, because it might not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requester have Ringo friends in common;
• - Any additional information for which you have given consent for us to share. For example, when you allow us to access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook;
• - With all users and the general public. We may share the following information with all users as well as the general public:
• - Public information like your profile pictures that you submit to Local. If a Local service is streamed on the web or broadcast in some other media, it could be viewed by the general public.
• - With our affiliates, we may share information with entities within the Ringo family of companies.
• - With third parties, we may share your information with the following third parties:
• - With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who carry out services on our behalf, sellers that offer goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.
• - With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is necessary to:
• - Comply with any valid legal process, government request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;
• - Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential violations of the Terms of Service;
• - Protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or detect and address any fraud or security concerns.
• - With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Ringo becomes involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some part of our business by another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction is completed.
• - In the aggregate or after de-identification. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
You explicitly consent that information provided when you register the App and/or the content you created when using the App (including without limitation, photos, text, messages, posts, html, URLs, pictures, video and other content), may be recorded, stored, published and made available to the rest of Ringo users. Furthermore, other users may follow you on the App, and your followers can see, for example, the user contributed content that you have uploaded to the App. Individuals reading this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities beyond our control and without your knowledge. We therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you consider private in the information you provide or the content you create in the App.
Your information may also be stored and processed in any country in which we provide service due to server facilities and third-party service teams. By using our service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
If you do not agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our service. Community safety is our top priority and some of the above user information is mandatory in order to create a safe community for all users.

The services might also incorporate third-party links and search results, include third-party integrations, or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that is being provided jointly with or by another company. By accessing those links, utilizing the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you might be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You recognize and consent that we are not accountable for how those third parties gather or utilize your information. To the extent that you employ a profile that might be accessible to others on our Service, you are solely responsible for its content and accuracy at all times. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.

Finally, and this is significant, you should comprehend that users who view the content you supply can always save it through various techniques: screenshots, in-app functionality, or any other image-capture technology. It is also possible, as with any digital information, that someone might be capable of accessing messages forensically or finding them in a device's temporary storage. If any deletion of user information of our App takes place, we cannot guarantee that the deletion will occur within a specific time frame. And we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period or as mandated by law.

Protecting user privacy and personal information is of primary importance to us. We process your personal information to enhance and enforce our security measures, fight spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks, and to monitor and verify your identity so that unauthorized users cannot access your account with us. Access to any user information is limited to our employees, contractors, agents, and third-party service providers ONLY who need to know the information in order to provide, operate, develop, maintain, support, and optimize our service experience and security. We employ password protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all user information. Due to the inherent nature of the internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the protection of information under our control against loss, misuse, or alteration.

        Control over Your Information

        <div class="section-content">
We aim to give you control over your information, and thus we offer you the following tools:
• - Access and Updates. We strive to enable you to access and manage the personal information we have on you. However, there are limitations to the requests we can fulfill. We may reject a request for several reasons, for instance, if the request poses a risk to the privacy of other users or is unlawful. You can access and update your account information directly in the app by visiting the Settings page of the app. If you need to access, update, or delete any other personal information we might have, you can submit a request here. Because your privacy is of significance to us, we might ask you to verify your identity or provide additional details before we permit you to access or update your personal information. You can also remove our service from your mobile device or proceed with account deletion.
• - Revoking Permissions. If you change your mind regarding our continuous ability to collect information from certain sources you have previously consented to, such as your phonebook, camera, photos, or location services, you can simply revoke your consent by adjusting the settings on your device if your device provides those options. Naturally, if you do so, certain services might lose their full functionality.
• - Erasure. You have the right to request the removal of your personal information under certain circumstances. Please be aware that your right to erasure might be restricted if the data are necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
• - Restriction on Processing: You have the right to object to and request restrictions on the processing of your personal information in specific circumstances.
• - Objection: You have the right to object, on the basis of your particular situation, at any time, to the processing of your personal information. Ringo shall no longer process the personal information unless Ringo demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims;
