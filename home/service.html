            Welcome to Ringo! We have formulated these Terms of Service (which
            we simply call "Terms") to ensure that you are acquainted with the
            regulations governing our relationship with you. Despite our
            attempts to minimize legal jargon in the Terms, there are still
            sections that might resemble a traditional contract. Please read
            them carefully. By using the Services, you agree to the Terms.
            Naturally, if you don't agree with them, then refrain from using the
            Services. The following Terms of Service outline your
            responsibilities when using our mobile application (“App”) or
            Service (as defined herein), or any of the information, text,
            graphics, videos, or other files, materials, data or content of any
            sort created or provided by or through the App or the Service or
            through your ability to sell products on the App and generate User
            Contributed Content (as defined herein). Kindly also review our
            Privacy Policy, which is a part of these Terms of Service and which
            details our approaches towards handling any personal information you
            might provide to us. Please read these Terms of Service carefully
            before using the App or the Service. By accessing the App or using
            any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by these terms and
            conditions. If you do not agree to all these terms and conditions,
            then you may not access the App or use the Service. Nothing in this
            Agreement shall be construed as conferring any rights or benefits to
            third parties. ARBITRATION NOTE: WE WANT TO INFORM YOU IN ADVANCE
            THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE FURTHER
            DOWN. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT
            ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND Ringo AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US
            WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND
            Ringo WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR
            CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

          <div class="section-content">
            No one under 18 is allowed to create an account or utilize the
            Services. We may offer additional Services with supplementary terms
            that might require you to be older to employ them. Therefore, please
            read all terms carefully. -You can form a binding contract with
            Ringo; -You will abide by these Terms and all applicable local,
            state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. If
            you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other
            entity, you assert that you are authorized to grant all licenses
            stipulated in these Terms and to consent to these Terms on behalf of
            the business or entity. If you are using the Services on behalf of
            an entity of the United States Government or Chinese Government, you
            agree to the Amendment to Ringo Terms of Service for the United
            States Government and Chinese Government Users. No one under 18 is
            permitted to create an account or use the Services. You hereby
            guarantee that you are at least 18 years old. In case the
            information you provide in this regard is untrue, Ringo will not be
            held responsible as it is unable to verify the age of its users. If
            you are under 18 years old, do not attempt to register for the App
            or the Service. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the
            Service only with the approval of your parent or guardian.
            Additionally, you should review these terms with your parent or
            guardian to ensure that you and your parent or guardian understand
            and agree with these terms.

            Ringo offers you a personal, global, royalty-free, non-assignable,
            non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access
            and employ the Services. This license is solely aimed at enabling
            you to utilize and relish the benefits of the Service in a manner
            consistent with these Terms and our usage policies. Any software we
            supply to you may automatically download and install enhancements,
            updates, or other new functionalities. You may have the capacity to
            regulate these automatic downloads through your device's settings.
            You are prohibited from copying, modifying, distributing, selling,
            or leasing any part of our Services. Additionally, you are not
            allowed to reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of
            that software, unless applicable laws prevent these restrictions or
            you have obtained our written consent to do so.

          <div class="section-content">
            A considerable number of our Services enable you to create, upload,
            post, send, receive, and store content. When you undertake such
            actions, you retain any ownership rights you initially held in that
            content. Nevertheless, you confer a license upon us to utilize that
            content. The scope of this license is contingent upon the services
            you employ and the settings you have selected. For all Services, you
            bestow upon Ringo a global, royalty-free, sublicenseable, and
            transferable license to host, store, utilize, display, reproduce,
            modify, adapt, edit, publish, and disseminate that content. This
            license is for the restricted purpose of operating, developing,
            providing, promoting, and enhancing the Services as well as
            researching and developing new ones. Since Local is inherently
            public and chronicles matters of public interest, the license you
            grant us for content submitted to those Services is more extensive.
            In addition to the rights you grant us in connection with other
            Services, you also confer upon us a perpetual license to create
            derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate,
            publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Local or
            any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and through any and all
            media or distribution methods (whether currently known or developed
            in the future). To the extent necessary, you also grant Ringo and
            our business partners the unrestricted, global, perpetual right and
            license to use your name, likeness, local content that you upload or
            send. This implies, among other things, that you will not be
            eligible for any compensation from Ringo or our business partners if
            your name, likeness, or Local. Although we are not obligated to do
            so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any
            time and for any reason, including if we consider your content to
            violate these Terms. However, you alone remain responsible for the
            content you create, upload, post, send, or store via the Service.
            The services might incorporate advertisements. In consideration for
            Ringo permitting you to access and utilize the Services, you consent
            that Ringo, its affiliates, and third-party partners may place
            advertising on the Services. We are always delighted to receive
            communications from our users. But if you voluntarily provide
            feedback or suggestions, be aware that we can utilize your ideas
            without compensating you.

            Services. Through these Terms, we make it clear that we do not want

            them. Before you finalize a purchase, you will always be shown the
            price for the Services. However, Ringo does not handle payments or
            payment processing for any purchases; these are managed by
            third-party payment providers or service providers (such as Apple's
            iOS Store and Google's Google Play Store, among others). Some
            third-party service providers might charge you sales tax, depending
            on your location. Please review the relevant terms of the
            third-party service provider for detailed information. Subject to
            any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are
            final and non-refundable. And because our performance begins as soon
            as you click buy and we provide you with immediate access to your
            purchase, you waive any right you might have under EU or other local
            law to cancel your purchase once it is completed or to obtain a
            refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT Ringo IS NOT
            OBLIGED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON. Some of the Virtual
            Products we offer are for single use only, while others are for
            repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does not mean
            "forever". We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual Products at
            any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will not be
            liable to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or
            terminate your account, you will lose any products you purchased
            through the services. If your Ringo account remains inactive for 3
            consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins may be frozen. To
            unfreeze such virtual Coins, you must email us and request that we
            unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receiving your request and
            reviewing your information, we will unfreeze your free virtual Coins
            as soon as possible. You agree that we have the absolute right to
            manage, distribute, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as
            we deem appropriate at our sole discretion, and that we will have no
            liability for exercising such right. You agree that under no
            circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or claims that
            might arise from the loss or use of your Coins regardless of the
            circumstances. It is your sole responsibility to manage your
            purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal
            majority in your place of residence), you must obtain the consent of
            your parent or guardian before making any purchases. Ringo does not
            transfer any funds and is not a money-services business. To the
            extent such functionality is available in the Services, it is
            provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other
            third-party service, it is subject to that third party's separate
            Terms of Service. Ringo offers in-app purchases ("IAP") through
            iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by
            Ringo. If you choose to make an IAP, you will be prompted to enter
            details for your account with your application platform, and your
            application platform account (e.g. iTunes Account) will be charged
            for the IAP in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the
            time of purchase as well as the general terms for IAP that apply to
            your application platform account. Some application platforms may
            charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase
            an auto-recurring periodic subscription IAP, your application
            platform account will continue to be billed for the subscription
            until you cancel the IAP. After your initial subscription commitment
            period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your
            subscription will automatically continue for an additional
            equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If
            you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you
            want to change or terminate your subscription, you can do so within
            the Ringo app or log in to your application platform account and
            follow the instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you
            have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted
            the Ringo application from your device. If you cancel your
            subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your
            then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be
            renewed after your then-current term expires. Deleting your account
            on Ringo or deleting the Ringo application from your device does not
            cancel your subscription; Ringo will retain all funds charged to
            your application platform until you cancel your subscription.
            Generally, all charges for IAP are non-refundable, and there are no
            refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an
            exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested
            within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws
            applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. For subscribers
            residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with
            local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days
            after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14-day period
            starts when the subscription commences. To request a refund: If you
            subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not
            Ringo. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID,
            select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit "Report
            Problem". You can also submit a request at
            https://getsupport.apple.com. If you subscribed using your Google
            Play Store account: please contact Google Play customer support with
            your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order
            number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google
            Wallet).

            To reward Users for certain activities, Ringo might offer you the
            chance to earn and utilize credits in Ringo’s in-app virtual
            currency (“Coins”), which can be employed to obtain virtual goods
            and services solely within the Services. Coins are not actual money,
            possess no monetary worth, and can never be exchanged for “real
            world” money or other items of monetary value from outside the
            Services without our written consent. Even though we might employ
            terms like “earn”, “trade-in”, or “cash-out” in relation to the
            Coins, we do this merely for convenience and such terms in no way
            imply that Coins have monetary value or are real money. You
            recognize that Coins are not real currency and cannot be redeemed
            for any amount of money from us at any time. We provide no guarantee
            regarding the nature, quality, or value of the features of the
            Services or any third-party goods or services that will be
            accessible through the use of Coins, or the availability or supply
            of Coins. Coins obtained through the Services are granted to you
            under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable,
            non-sublicensable license for usage within the Services. Coins
            cannot be transferred to other accounts or resold in any manner,
            have no property interest, right or title in or to any Coins
            displayed or originating in the Services or any other attributes
            associated with the use of the Services. Any “virtual currency”
            balance shown in your account does not represent a real-world
            balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a
            measurement of the extent of your license. All Coins are forfeited
            if your account or access to the Services is terminated or suspended
            for any reason, at our sole and absolute discretion, or if we cease
            the availability of some or all of the Services. We may at any time
            expire free or promotional Coins given to you. We have no liability
            for the hacking or loss of your Coins or any goods or services
            acquired using Coins. We have no obligation to, and will not,
            reimburse you for any Coins that are lost due to your violation of
            these Terms. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to
            limit the quantity of Coins and to refuse to provide you with any
            Coins. The price, exchangeability and availability of Coins are
            determined by us at our sole discretion and are subject to change
            without notice. You agree that we have the absolute right to manage,
            distribute, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as we deem
            appropriate at our sole discretion, and that we will have no
            liability for exercising such right. You agree that under no
            circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or claims that
            might arise from the loss or use of your Coins regardless of the
            circumstances. User inactivity - If your account remains inactive
            for 3 consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins may be
            frozen. To unfreeze such virtual Coins, you must email us and
            request that we unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receiving
            your request and reviewing your information, we will unfreeze your
            free virtual Coins as soon as possible. You absolve us of any
            responsibility for maintaining or updating your account Coins
            balance. However, if there is a loss of Coins in your account due to
            technical or operational issues with the Services, we will refund
            the lost Coins once the loss has been verified. Without limiting any
            of the foregoing, our maximum liability or responsibility towards
            you is to refund the lost Coins. You may from time to time be
            presented with opportunities to redeem Coins. We will, at our sole
            discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange
            rate for any Coins, which may be modified at any time. We reserve
            the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Coins at any time for any
            reason. All redemptions are subject to these Terms and all
            limitations and requirements stated via the Services. All
            acquisitions and redemptions of Coins are final. Once Coins have
            been lost or spent, they will be deducted from your account and
            cannot be refunded or returned, except at our sole discretion.

            PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY AS THEY IMPOSE ON YOU
            THE REQUIREMENT TO SETTLE DISPUTES WITH Ringo VIA ARBITRATION AND
            LIMIT THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK COMPENSATION FROM US.
            Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All assertions and conflicts
            emerging from or related to these Terms or the employment of the
            Services that cannot be resolved in a small claims court will be
            dealt with through compulsory arbitration on an individual level,
            except where either you or Ringo seek fair compensation for the
            alleged illegal utilization of copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
            logos, trade secrets, or patents. Arbitration Rules. The
            interpretation and implementation of this dispute-resolution
            provision are governed by the United States Arbitration Law.
            Arbitration will commence through the United States International
            Economic and Trade Arbitration (“USIETAC”). If the USIETAC is unable
            to conduct the arbitration, the parties will pick an alternative
            arbitration forum. The rules of the arbitration forum will oversee
            all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent that those
            rules conflict with these Terms. Additional Rules for Non-appearance
            Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is selected, the
            arbitration will be conducted via telephone, online, written
            submissions, or any combination of these three; the specific method
            will be determined by the party initiating the arbitration. The
            arbitration will not involve any in-person appearance by the parties
            or witnesses unless both parties mutually agree otherwise. Authority
            of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will establish the jurisdiction of
            the arbitrator and the rights and obligations, if any, of you and
            Ringo. The dispute will not be merged with any other matters or
            associated with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator has the
            authority to grant motions that handle all or part of any claim or
            dispute. The arbitrator has the authority to award monetary damages
            and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an
            individual under applicable law, the rules of the arbitration forum,
            and the Terms. The arbitrator will provide a written award and
            statement of decision outlining the key findings and conclusions on
            which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages
            granted. The arbitrator holds the same authority to grant relief on
            an individual basis as a judge in a court of law. The arbitrator's
            award is final and binding on both you and Ringo. Waiver of Class or
            Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF
            THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED
            INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS FROM MORE THAN ONE
            CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED TOGETHER OR
            COMBINED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. However, if this
            waiver of class or consolidated actions is considered invalid or
            unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.
            Confidentiality. No part of the proceedings will be available to the
            public or the media. All evidence discovered or submitted during the
            hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except with the
            written consent of the parties, in accordance with a court order, or
            unless required by law. Despite the above, no party will be
            prevented from submitting to a court of law any information
            necessary to enforce this arbitration agreement, to enforce an
            arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or fair relief. Right to
            Waive. Any rights and limitations specified in this arbitration
            agreement can be waived by the party against whom the claim is made.
            Such a waiver will not nullify or affect any other portion of this
            arbitration agreement. Opt-out. You have the option to withdraw from
